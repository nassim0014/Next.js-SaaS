## 🎯 Why use this?

You're a SaaS founder. You have a product idea. You don't have 6 weeks to wire up auth, RBAC, multi-tenancy, billing, audit logs, GDPR, RAG, and cost metering.

**This boilerplate ships all of that on day one.**

| | Built from scratch | With this boilerplate |
|---|---|---|
| Time to first commit | 0 | 0 |
| Time to working auth + RBAC | 5–7 days | 0 minutes |
| Time to multi-tenant schema | 3–5 days | 0 minutes |
| Time to Stripe + Lemon Squeezy billing | 4–6 days | 0 minutes |
| Time to AI streaming chat + RAG | 5–7 days | 0 minutes |
| Time to GDPR export/erase | 2–3 days | 0 minutes |
| Time to **AI cost observability** | 1–2 weeks | 0 minutes |
| **Total time saved** | — | **4–6 weeks** |

### ⭐ The Unique Selling Proposition

Every AI SaaS founder gets burned by unexpected token bills. Most boilerplates give you a chat box and call it a day. We don't.

**AI Cost Observability is built into every LLM call:**

- Every token is metered and attributed to `org + user + conversation + model`
- Per-org budget caps fire alerts at 80% / 100% of quota
- Usage-based overage billing reconciled via Stripe metered billing
- Live `/usage` dashboard shows per-day, per-agent, per-user cost breakdowns
- No more "why did OpenAI charge me $400 last month?" panic

### 🎁 Six systems, pre-integrated

1. **Multi-tenancy** — shared DB with `organizationId` everywhere, RLS as defense-in-depth
2. **RBAC + Audit Log** — type-safe `can(user, "agents:create")` checks, immutable audit trail on every mutation
3. **Billing Engine** — Stripe + Lemon Squeezy, idempotent webhook reconciliation, metered usage (not just a checkout button)
4. **AI Stack** — Vercel AI SDK, multi-provider (Gemini free, Groq free, OpenAI, Anthropic), RAG with pgvector
5. **⭐ AI Cost Observability** — see above
6. **GDPR Compliance** — one-click data export (ZIP), one-click right-to-erasure with audit trail

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (under 2 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (`node -v`)
- **A Supabase project** (free tier — [create one here](https://supabase.com/dashboard))
- **An LLM API key** — at least one of:
  - ⭐ Google Gemini (free): https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
  - ⭐ Groq (free): https://console.groq.com/keys
  - OpenAI (paid): https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
  - Anthropic (paid): https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

### 3 steps

```bash
# 1. Clone + install
git clone https://github.com/nassim0014/Next.js-SaaS.git
cd Next.js-SaaS
pnpm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local — fill in your Supabase URL + anon key + service role key + DATABASE_URL
# And at least one LLM API key (Gemini free works!)

# 3. Set up the database + run
bash scripts/setup.sh
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — you're live.

### 🤖 Bonus: MCP-powered development

This is the **only** AI SaaS boilerplate that ships with MCP (Model Context Protocol) pre-configured. Open the project in Cursor, VS Code (with Cline), or Claude Desktop, and your AI assistant can:

- Read your Next.js routes via the `next-devtools` MCP server
- Query your Supabase database via the `supabase` MCP server
- Validate your Prisma schema via the `Prisma` MCP server

See [`docs/MCP-SETUP.md`](docs/MCP-SETUP.md) for the 15-minute setup walkthrough.

## 💰 Pricing & Monetization

This boilerplate is dual-licensed:

- **MIT** — for personal / learning / open-source projects. Free forever.
- **Commercial** — required if you sell a product built on this, or use it internally at a company with >5 developers.

Plans ship pre-configured in the `Plan` table (seeded by `prisma/seed.ts`):

| Plan | Price | Tokens/mo | Seats | Storage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Free | $0 | 50K | 1 | 100 MB |
| Starter | $19/mo | 500K | 3 | 1 GB |
| Pro | $49/mo | 5M | 10 | 10 GB |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |

Customize plans in `src/lib/billing/plans.ts` + `prisma/seed.ts` (single source of truth).

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Add a new LLM model

1. Add it to `src/config/models.ts` (with pricing)
2. Add it to the `AVAILABLE_MODELS` array in `prisma/seed.ts`
3. Run `pnpm db:seed`
4. It now appears in the agent creation UI

### Add a new permission / role

1. Add the action string to `DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS` in `src/lib/auth/permissions.ts`
2. Run `pnpm db:seed` (syncs to the `Permission` table)
3. Use `can(user.role, "your:new_action")` in your route guard

### Add a new webhook event

1. Dispatch it from anywhere: `await dispatchWebhookEvent(orgId, "your.event", { ... })`
2. Users subscribe to it from `/dashboard/settings/webhooks`
3. HMAC-signed delivery + exponential backoff retry handled automatically

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### Free-tier-friendly deploy (recommended)

Deploy to **Cloudflare Pages** (free, commercial-OK) — see [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full guide.

### Vercel

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Add the env vars from `.env.example` in the Vercel dashboard. Configure Stripe webhooks to point to `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`.

### Self-hosted

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Use a process manager (PM2, systemd) + a reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx).

---

## 🔐 Security

- **Row-Level Security** on every tenant-scoped table (see `supabase/migrations/0002_rls_policies.sql`)
- **Service-role key** never exposed to the client (enforced via `lib/supabase/admin.ts`)
- **API keys** stored as argon2 hashes (never plaintext)
- **Webhook signatures** verified with constant-time comparison
- **Audit log** on every mutation (GDPR-friendly)
- **GDPR export/erase** built in (`/dashboard/settings/compliance`)

See [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.
